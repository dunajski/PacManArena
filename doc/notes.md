# PacManArena Development Notes

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to improve C++ knowledge, particularly in object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Decision Log
- **Graphics Approach**: Chose to use SFML's shape-drawing capabilities instead of textures. This decision was made to save time, as the project does not require polished graphics. The focus is on improving programming skills rather than visual design.
